# Flower-Classification (deep neural network with TensorFlow)

Flower classification system based on deep neural network model to recognize and distinguish between 5 types of flowers (Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower and Tulip).  The system contains a model that we trained on over more than 4,00 images. (BGU project)

<H2>Features </H2>

* You can choose between loading an existing model or create your own model.
* The classification results are presented by the system.

<H2> Prerequisites </H2>

This project which is part of BGU home work has involves Python 3.6 ,numpy and TensorFlow.

*	Python 3.6 .
*	TensorFlow 1.14 .
*	numpy 1.17 .
*	Pillow 6.1.0.
*	matplotlib 3.1.1.

<H2>Steps</H2>
  
The main file of the project is: Flower_Classification.py, in order to start the system please run this as the main.
1. Use the ‘Browse’ buttons to choose the images folder and the model file.
2. Choose the ‘Predict’ button in order predict the classification of the input-images in the input-folder.

<H2>Results</H2>
  
1. By submit the ‘Predict’ button, the classification results will appear in the main program window.
2. So you can scroll down and see the classification for each image in the input.
3. The project folder will contain a results.csv file which will contain images' names and their classification.
